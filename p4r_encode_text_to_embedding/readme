embeddings.model  is the one that gonna encode our item profiles

projection.py is file that gonna project the encoded embeddings into small embeddings to use for our model


print_pt_file is only to see the item_embeddings.pt  (pt file contain dictionnary that has key and value  , the key represent item id and the value of the key is the embeddings,  the keys are sorted since i sorted item profiles before)


PS : i have sorted bussiness_df in the model that generate item profiles, so i think we dont have to sort it again,   you can check for safety in case
